    nju_desc2: This method predicts the future activity status of open source projects
      based on OSS Compass metrics. The method uses a feature-based time series classification
      prediction method by extracting statistical features from the OSS Compass metric
      sequence. It trains and applies machine learning intelligent classification
      models to predict the future active/inactive status of projects and provides
      approximate probability estimates. Cross-validation results on nearly 600 project
      datasets show an accuracy rate close to 90% for this method. In terms of generalization
      ability, this method can still achieve an accuracy rate of 80% on a dataset
      of over ten thousand repositories, demonstrating its preliminary practicality.
      The analysis results can partially reflect the future health status of open
      source projects and demonstrate the effectiveness of the OSS Compass metric
      system in measuring the health of open source software. This method is expected
      to provide valuable reference information for users, developers, investors,
      and managers of open source software.
    nju2_title: An Information Entropy-Based Approach to Quantify Community Evolution
      in Open Source Developer Social Networks

      Technology, Nanjing University - National Key Laboratory of Software New Technology,

    nju2_author2: 'Advisor: Liang Wang, Xianping Tao'
    nju2_desc: 'Introduction: In this study, we study the community evolution behavior
      in developer social networks around open source software projects, in response
      to the limitation of traditional community evolution analysis techniques being
      biased towards qualitative rather than quantitative analysis. We propose a set
      of community split, shrink, merge, and expand indices based on information entropy
      to measure the evolutionary behavior of open source developer social networks.
      Empirical studies demonstrate that these indices effectively characterize the
      evolution of open source communities, by achieving a 94.1% accuracy in drawing
      conclusions consistent with existing qualitative work through simple rules.
      Furthermore, additional research indicates a significant correlation between
      the proposed community evolution indices and the productivity of open source
      projects, represented by the number of commits. The information entropy-based
      measurement indices presented in this study provide quantitative support for
      understanding and analyzing the evolutionary behavior of open source communities.

      Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University - National
      Key Laboratory of Software New Technology, OSS Compass Community'
    nju3_author2: 'Advisor: Liang Wang, Xianping Tao'
    nju3_desc: 'Introduction: This research focuses on project forks on open-source
      software (OSS) platforms, revolving around measuring and understanding the diversity
      of forks in open-source software projects. The paper accomplishes this by constructing
      a novel fork entropy based on Rao''s second entropy and assessing this diversity
      based on modifications to project files. Empirical studies indicate a significant
      correlation between fork entropy in open-source projects and various key outcomes,
      including external productivity of the project (measured by the number of contributions
      from external contributors), acceptance rate of external contributors'' pull
      requests, and the reported number of bugs. Additionally, we observe significant
      interactions between fork entropy and other factors, such as the quantity of
      forks. These findings suggest that fork entropy, as an effective metric, not
      only enhances the current available measurements of forks in open-source software
      projects but also deepens our understanding of the development process based
      on forked repositories. It holds the potential to support further research and
      applications. Reference article:'
    pku1_title: 'Intelligent Recommendation for Beginner Tasks: GFI-Bot'
    pku1_author: 'Author: Wenxin Xiao, Ph.D. candidate at Peking University'
    pku1_author2: 'Advisor: Professor Minghui Zhou'
    pku1_desc1: 'Introduction: On the GitHub platform, many projects use the ''good
      first issue'' (GFI) labeling mechanism to mark problems suitable for beginners,
      guiding them to make their first contributions to the project by addressing
      these introductory tasks. Tan et al.''s research found that the popularity of
      this mechanism is gradually increasing. However, in most projects, the proportion
      of issues marked as GFI is relatively low. What is even more concerning is that
      the resolution rate of GFI issues is not optimistic. Among all GFI issues, only
      about 60% are successfully solved by beginners, and a large number of GFI issues
      remain unresolved. On platforms like GitHub, each issue contains not only a
      title and description but also diverse features such as labels and comments.
      Therefore, Xiao et al. proposed an automatic labeling method for beginner tasks
      based on multiple task features. Using an XGBoost classifier, they classify
      issues solved by beginners from other issues at two time points: when the issue
      is opened and when it is resolved.'

    pku2_author: 'Authors: Haiqiao Gu, Hao He and Yiliang Zhao, PhD candidates at
      Peking University'
    pku2_author2: 'Advisor: Professor Minghui Zhou, Academician Huaimin Wang'
    pku2_desc1: 'Introduction: With the rise of open source software (OSS) and the
      development of software package hosting platform, more and more developers choose
      to reuse existing third-party libraries for project development, so as to reduce
      development costs and improve development efficiency. However, in the process
      of reusing third-party libraries, when developers cannot solve the problems
      existing in the library through promotion and degradation, such as security
      vulnerabilities, compatibility, etc., they need to replace it with another third-party
      library with the same or similar functions, this operation is called library
      migration. However, due to the limited information available, developers often
      choose alternative libraries based on subjective opinions. By analyzing the
      historical development activities and ranking the library migration using multiple
      indicators, we can recommend the most suitable library migration scheme. Firstly,
      the migration history is mined from a large number of software warehouses, and
      the migration knowledge base is constructed. Given a library that needs to be
      migrated, select the candidate target libraries and then rank them by combining
      relevant metrics that capture evidence from different dimensions of development
      history: rule support, cause support, distance support, and API support; Through
      intelligent analysis of a large number of GitHub repositories, it is possible
      to recommend the target of outbound migration.'

    pku3_desc1: 'Introduction: When developers face a large number of similar licenses
      and complex legal terms, the problem of how to choose the right open source
      license for their projects arises. Xu et al. proposed LicenseRec, an open source
      software license recommendation tool, aiming to help users select licenses that
      meet their preferences based on compliance with third-party component licenses,
      open source style, business requirements, and community development. To achieve
      this goal, a knowledge base was built, which includes common license terms,
      compatibility information, and license selection guidelines. The workflow involves
      scanning the licenses of third-party components, checking license compatibility,
      and characterizing user preferences through user interaction. Then, based on
      this information, the tool recommends the most suitable license. This tool can
      scan and check the licenses of third-party components for compatibility and
      also characterize user preferences to recommend licenses that best meet their
      needs.'

      code_contributor_count: Code Contributor Count
      code_contributor_count_desc: Determine how many active pr creators, code reviewers,
        commit authors there are in the past 90 days.
      code_contributor_count_value:

      title: Git
      commit_frequency: Commit Frequency
      commit_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of commits per week in the
        past 90 days.
      commit_frequency_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 1000
      commit_frequency_more:
        weight: 16.363%
        threshold: '1000'
        detail: As an outcome indicator of this model, it identifies the sustainability
          and quantity of project contributions. Refers to the overall workload of
          the project.
      is_maintained: Is Maintained
      is_maintained_desc: Percentage of weeks with at least one code commit in the
        past 90 days(single repository). Percentage of code repositories with at least
        one code commit in the last 30 days(multiple repositories).
      is_maintained_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 1
      is_maintained_more:
        weight: 13.853%
        threshold: 100%
        detail: This metric is used to determine whether the repository is being maintained
          on an ongoing basis. An actively maintained projects may be more resistant
          to risks such as vulnerabilities. It is related to the Commit Frequency,
          but the focus is different. The former focuses on the number of code contributions
          during the cycle, while the latter focuses on the continuity of the code
          contributions. But we should not draw any direct conclusions about projects
          that are low on this indicator, and further insights are needed.
        notes: definitions of single repository and multiple repositories are differerent.
      commit_pr_linked_ratio: Commit PR Linked Ratio
      commit_pr_linked_ratio_desc: Determine the percentage of new code commit link
        pull request in the last 90 days.
      commit_pr_linked_ratio_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 1
      commit_pr_linked_ratio_more:
        weight: 12.612%
        threshold: 100%
        detail: This indicator is used to determine whether the code submission has
          gone through the PR process. To determine whether a project is open source,
          perhaps we can verify the License it declares. But whether open source projects
          use open community collaboration model to develop, and whether the community
          is willing to build community with open source contributors and organizational
          partners, it is not enough to rely on License alone. Here we examine the
          project's willingness to collaborate by informing contributors in an open
          and transparent manner about the purpose of the code submission, whether
          it is a PR or not, and by being reviewed.
      commit_count: Commit Count
      commit_count_desc: Determine the number of commits in the past 90 days.
      commit_pr_linked_count: Commit PR Linked Count
      commit_pr_linked_count_desc: Determine the numbers of new code commit link pull
        request in the last 90 days.
      created_since: Created Since
      created_since_desc: Determine how long a repository has existed since it was
        created (in months).
      created_since_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 120
      updated_since: Updated Since
      updated_since_desc: Determine the average time per repository since the repository
        was last updated (in days).
      updated_since_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 0.25
      updated_since_more:
        weight: 12.74%
        threshold: 0.25 months
        detail: This metric is used to indicate how often the project is updated.
          It identifies good communities for development collaboration and management,
          and makes frequent iterative and incremental development to promote continuous
          improvement in software quality. But the industr domains of a software project
          also determines that the frequency of its iterations is not always as high
          as possible, some Linux distribution projects, for example, exhibit a very
          typical pattern of code iterations with periodic release planning. Here
          we focus on the trend of the project during each cycle, and the relative
          results compared with the projects belong to the similar domains.
      org_count: Org Count
      org_count_desc: Number of organizations to which active code contributors belong
        in the past 90 days.
      org_count_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 30
      org_count_more:
        weight: 32.258%
        threshold: '30'
        detail: What we count here are the organizations that contribute code. The
          reason for only counting code contributions is that code contributions have
          the highest technical threshold compared to other types of community contributions,
          and are the most direct manifestation of an organization's participation
          in community contributions. At the same time through the analysis of the
          organization's categories, we can also be more in-depth insight, such as
          understanding of the project's north-south ecological construction, etc.
      org_commit_frequency: Org Commit Frequency
      org_commit_frequency_desc: 'Definition: Determine the average number of commits
        with organization affiliation per week in the past 90 days.'
      org_commit_frequency_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 800
      org_contribution_last: Org contribution last
      org_contribution_last_desc: Total contribution time of all organizations to
        the community in the past 90 days (weeks).
      org_contribution_last_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 160
      lines_of_code_frequency: Lines of Code Frequency
      lines_of_code_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of lines touched
        (lines added plus lines removed) per week in the past 90 days.
      lines_of_code_frequency_value:
        threshold: Between 0 and 300000
      lines_of_code_frequency_more:
        weight: 5.640%
        threshold: '300000'
        detail: The number of lines of source code is indeed strongly correlated with
          the amount of work, but it is less correlated with the value created. What
          forms of code can be counted in the LOC, are uncertain factors. We do not
          care so much about the code form(program language, configuration files etc),
          only use it as the description of the workload, so its weight in the overall
          metrics model is low.
      lines_add_of_code_frequency: Lines Add of Code Frequency
      lines_add_of_code_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of lines touched
        (lines added) per week in the past 90.
      lines_remove_of_code_frequency: Lines Remove of Code Frequency
      lines_remove_of_code_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of lines touched
        (lines removed) per week in the past 90.
    issue:
      title: Issue
      issue_first_reponse: Issue First Response
      issue_first_reponse_desc: Average/Median first comments response (in days) for
        new issues created in the last 90 days. This excludes bot responses, the creator's
        own comment, or an action assigned by the issue. If the issue has been unanswered,
        the first response time is not counted.
      bug_issue_open_time: Bug Issue Open Time
      bug_issue_open_time_desc: Average/Median time (days) that bug issues have been
        opened for issues created in the last 90 days.
      comment_frequency: Comment Frequency
      comment_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of comments per issue created
        in the last 90 days.
      updated_issues_count: Updated Issues Count

    collaboration_development_index:
      title: Collaboration Development Index
      desc: Open source projects, as a typical manifestation of human group intelligence,
        the ability to establish collaborative development management is a key element
        contributing to the success of the project. And code, as the final output
        of a project, is the essence of the entire community's contribution. So we
        evaluate how well the development process is managed and how well the community
        does collaborative development around a series of indirect metrics related
        to code contribution.
      metrics:
        contributor_count: Code Contributor Count
        contributor_count_desc: Determine how many active pr creators, code reviewers,
          commit authors there are in the past 90 days.
        contributor_count_more:
          weight: 19.987%
          threshold: '1000'
          detail: Here we focus on the number of contributors directly related to
            the code contribution. As a result of this model, it identifies a well-managed
            community of development collaborations that are gathering more and more
            active code contributors. We believe that some types of the Issue are
            also related to code contributions, such as Bug , new requirements, and
            so on, and will eventually introduce code contributions. But as a general
            indicator, it is difficult to identify issues in a uniform way (such as
            a Bug type) within the specific type of each project, because each project
            has a different definition and understanding of the Bug type. So we made
            a trade-off, choosing only PR-related and Code Commit-related contributors
            as insight objects.
        commit_frequency: Commit Frequency
        commit_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of commits per week in
          the past 90 days.
        commit_frequency_more:
          weight: 16.363%
          threshold: '1000'
          detail: As an outcome indicator of this model, it identifies the sustainability
            and quantity of project contributions. Refers to the overall workload
            of the project.
        is_maintained: Is Maintained
        is_maintained_desc: Percentage of weeks with at least one code commit in the
          past 90 days(single repository). Percentage of code repositories with at
          least one code commit in the last 30 days(multiple repositories).
        is_maintained_more:
          weight: 13.853%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: This metric is used to determine whether the repository is being
            maintained on an ongoing basis. An actively maintained projects may be
            more resistant to risks such as vulnerabilities. It is related to the
            Commit Frequency, but the focus is different. The former focuses on the
            number of code contributions during the cycle, while the latter focuses
            on the continuity of the code contributions. But we should not draw any
            direct conclusions about projects that are low on this indicator, and
            further insights are needed.
          notes: definitions of single repository and multiple repositories are differerent.
        commit_pr_linked_ratio: Commit PR Linked Ratio
        commit_pr_linked_ratio_desc: Determine the percentage of new code commit link
          pull request in the last 90 days.
        commit_pr_linked_ratio_more:
          weight: 12.612%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: This indicator is used to determine whether the code submission
            has gone through the PR process. To determine whether a project is open
            source, perhaps we can verify the License it declares. But whether open
            source projects use open community collaboration model to develop, and
            whether the community is willing to build community with open source contributors
            and organizational partners, it is not enough to rely on License alone.
            Here we examine the project's willingness to collaborate by informing
            contributors in an open and transparent manner about the purpose of the
            code submission, whether it is a PR or not, and by being reviewed.
        pr_issue_linked_ratio: PR Issue Linked Ratio
        pr_issue_linked_ratio_desc: Determine the percentage of new pull request link
          issues in the last 90 days.
        pr_issue_linked_ratio_more:
          weight: 11.319%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: This metric is used to see if the code contributions are based upon
            open discussion, for example using the Issue. Note that not all issues
            result in code contributions, such as an Issue for the advisory type,
            there would be no code modifications generally . At the same time, we
            should also note that if PR goes through public discussion, Issue is not
            the only way, it may come from discussion in the forum. Therefore, we
            can not blindly pursue the high proportion of this indicator.
        code_review_ratio: Code Review Ratio
        code_review_ratio_desc: Determine the percentage of code commits with at least
          one reviewer (not PR creator) in the last 90 days.
        code_review_ratio_more:
          weight: 10.113%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: If a PR is merged without being reviewed by others, the probability
            of a code defect or vulnerability being introduced, intentionally or unintentionally,
            is greatly increased. Code reviews do not fully protect against this risk,
            but they greatly improve the introduction of risk.
        code_merge_ratio: Code Merge Ratio
        code_merge_ratio_desc: Determine the percentage of PR Mergers and PR authors
          who are not the same person in the last 90 days of commits.
        code_merge_ratio_more:
          weight: 10.113%
          threshold: 100%
          detail: This metric was observed in conjunction with the Code Review Ratio.
            When we introduced a third-party review, but if the PR creator intentionally
            or unintentionally ignored the third-party review and merged the code
            directly, there are also risks. It's important to note that the Code Review
            Ratio and Code Merge Ratio are one best practices we observe in opensource
            communities, but rather the only standards. We also see in some communities
            based on trust in some good, long-term contributors, these people are
            granted the right to merge their own code direclty.
        lines_of_code_frequency: Lines of Code Frequency
        lines_of_code_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of lines touched
          (lines added plus lines removed) per week in the past 90 days.
        lines_of_code_frequency_more:
          weight: 5.640%
          threshold: '300000'
          detail: The number of lines of source code is indeed strongly correlated
            with the amount of work, but it is less correlated with the value created.
            What forms of code can be counted in the LOC, are uncertain factors. We
            do not care so much about the code form(program language, configuration
            files etc), only use it as the description of the workload, so its weight
            in the overall metrics model is low.
    community_service_and_support:
      title: Community Service and Support
      desc: Community Service and Support measures the quality of services and support
        provided by the community as directly perceived by a developer during the
        contribution process. The emphasis on direct perception comes from the fact
        that many of the underlying services provided by the community, such as the
        Devops infrastructure involved in the development, are also key elements in
        building community services, but are difficult for the community participants
        to perceive. At the same time, they are also lack of a universal means of
        assessment. We use the metric dimension that participants perceive in community-based
        development to indirectly evaluate the community's entire 'Marathon-like logistic
        system in open source contribution'. It should be noted that this does not
        mean that only the metrics mentioned in the model are sufficient, in order
        to ensure the independence of indicators, the model has done a strong correlation
        index dimension reduction; So if you want to maintain the long-term positive
        development of the model, the community's efforts go far beyond what the current
        metrics contain.
      metrics:
        updated_issues_count: Updated Issues Count
        updated_issues_count_desc: Determine the number of issues updated in the last
          90 days.
        updated_issues_count_more:
          weight: 19.721%
          threshold: '2000'
          detail: There are two reasons why we chose to use the number of Issue updates
            instead of counting the number of issues that were closed or resolved.
            First, there are many different types of issues, such as bugs, new function
            requirements, user inquiries, and CVEs. Only certain types of problems,
            such as CVES, must be resolved quickly. For other types of issues, quick
            Issue resolution is not pursued usually, and we need to communicate with
            the issue creator multiple times to better understand the details that
            takes time. If the functional requirements, from acceptance to resolution,
            are in accordance with the release plan, such scenarios may also take
            several months. Second, from the number of Issue updates, we can monitor
            the activity of the Issue processing. The issue update can also include
            reopening the issue, indicating concern about changes in the understanding
            of the issue.
        close_pr_count: Close PR Count
        close_pr_count_desc: The number of PR accepted and declined in the last 90
          days.
        close_pr_count_more:
          weight: 19.721%
          threshold: '4500'
          detail: The more code you contribute, the more PR requests you need to close
            (accept or reject) . This indicates that the community is actively dealing
            with the PR. We use this metric together with Close PR Count as an outcome
            measure of the model, to provide an overall view of community service
            and support.
        issue_first_response: Issue First Response
        issue_first_response_desc: Average/Median first comments response (in days)
          for new issues created in the last 90 days. This excludes bot responses,
          the creator's own comment, or an action assigned by the issue. If the issue
          has been unanswered, the first response time is not counted.
        issue_first_response_more:
          weight: 14.372%
          threshold: 15 days
          detail: We use this indicator to sense "Community temperature". And for
            contributors who join the community, if their questions are answered in
            a timely manner by the community, there's a good chance that they would
            be retained and continue to contribute to the community (according to
            Mozilla Research) . At the same time, we found that more and more robots
            have been used to assist with Issue processing in recent years, so we
            eliminated robot interference and focused on human replies.
        bug_issue_open_time: Bug Issue Open Time
        bug_issue_open_time_desc: Average/Median time (days) that bug issues have
          been opened for issues created in the last 90 days.
        bug_issue_open_time_more:
          weight: 12.88%
          threshold: 60 days
          notes: Issue that labeled by Bugs.
          detail: The Bug type Issue represents how efficiently the community handles
            issues that need to be resolved quickly. We chose to use Bug Issue to
            represent this type of Issues, which of course has its limitations, because
            not all bugs are high-priority ones, but rather than not distinguishing
            the Issue types, this index has some representativeness.
        pr_open_time: PR Open Time
        pr_open_time_desc: Average/Median processing time (days) for new change requests
          created in the last 90 days, including closed/accepted change requests and
          unresolved change requests.
        pr_open_time_more:
          weight: 12.88%
          threshold: 30 days
          detail: We are seeking for the change request fast close, including code
            merged or rejected. Otherwise the longer it takes for a change request
            to be resolved, the greater the risk that merge-conflict will occur, while
            other change requests that depend on it will also be stalled.
        comment_frequency: Comment Frequency
        comment_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of comments per issue
          created in the last 90 days.
        comment_frequency_more:
          weight: 10.217%
          threshold: '5'
          detail: We would like to see the community encourage open and transparent
            discussion around specific bugs or requirements through Issue. The corresponding
            conclusions of the Issue can also be accumulated as a knowledge base and
            made available to more people.
        code_review_count: Code Review Count
        code_review_count_desc: Determine the average number of review comments per
          pull request created in the last 90 days.
        code_review_count_more:
          weight: 10.217%
          threshold: '8'
          detail: We hope that code could be reviewed publicly by PR that shows how
            much the community values code quality and security management, and helps
            new people grow quickly.
    community_activity:
      title: Community Activity
      desc: Community Activity is used to describe how active an open source community
        is.In order for an open source project to be sustainable, it must continue
        to be maintained and improved following its initial release. Activity describes
        how much work is being done on a project over time. High levels of community
        activity may indicate that a project is sustainable and low levels of community
        activity may indicate that a project is at risk.
      metrics:
        contributor_count: Contributor Count
        contributor_count_desc: Determine how many active code commit authors, pr
          authors, review participants, issue authors, and issue comments participants
          there are in the past 90 days.
        contributor_count_more:
          weight: 18.01%
          threshold: '2000'
          notes: when a person has more than one contributions with different roles
            in multiple repositories, like code commit author and issue author, we
            only count once.
          detail: In this model, we include all types of contributors to the project
            hosted by code host platform(Github, Gitee etc). Because we think that
            project activity is made up of all types of contributing behavior, and
            the more active contributors there are, the more important the project
            is.
        commit_frequency: Commit Frequency
        commit_frequency_desc: Determine the average number of commits per week in
          the past 90 days.
        commit_frequency_more:
          weight: 18.01%
          threshold: '1000'
          detail: As an outcome indicator of this model, it identifies the sustainability
            and quantity of project contributions. Refers to the overall workload
            of the project.
        updated_since: Updated Since
        updated_since_desc: Determine the average time per repository since the repository
          was last updated (in days).
        updated_since_more:
          weight: 12.74%
          threshold: 0.25 months
          detail: This metric is used to indicate how often the project is updated.
            It identifies good communities for development collaboration and management,
            and makes frequent iterative and incremental development to promote continuous
            improvement in software quality. But the industr domains of a software
            project also determines that the frequency of its iterations is not always
            as high as possible, some Linux distribution projects, for example, exhibit
            a very typical pattern of code iterations with periodic release planning.
            Here we focus on the trend of the project during each cycle, and the relative
            results compared with the projects belong to the similar domains.
        organization_count: Organization Count
        organization_count_desc: Number of organizations to which active code contributors

          threshold: '10'
          detail: The more organizations that participate in the project's ongoing
            contribution, the more organizations that rely heavily on the project.
            This will greatly promote the establishment and prosperity of ecology.
        created_since: Created Since
        created_since_desc: Determine how long a repository has existed since it was
          created (in months).
        comment_frequency: Comment Frequency

          created in the last 90 days.
        comment_frequency_more:
          weight: 7.77%
          threshold: '5'
          detail: We would like to see the community encourage open and transparent
            discussion around specific bugs or requirements through Issue. The corresponding
            conclusions of the Issue can also be accumulated as a knowledge base and
            made available to more people.
        code_review_count: Code Review Count
        code_review_count_desc: Determine the average number of review comments per
          pull request created in the last 90 days.
        code_review_count_more:
          weight: 4.92%
          threshold: '8'
          detail: We hope that code could be reviewed publicly by PR that shows how
            much the community values code quality and security management, and helps
            new people grow quickly.
        updated_issues_count: Updated Issues Count
        updated_issues_count_desc: Determine the number of issues updated in the last
          90 days.
        updated_issues_count_more:
          weight: 4.92%
          threshold: '2500'
          detail: There are two reasons why we chose to use the number of Issue updates
            instead of counting the number of issues that were closed or resolved.
            First, there are many different types of issues, such as bugs, new function
            requirements, user inquiries, and CVEs. Only certain types of problems,
            such as CVES, must be resolved quickly. For other types of issues, quick
            Issue resolution is not pursued usually, and we need to communicate with
            the issue creator multiple times to better understand the details that
            takes time. If the functional requirements, from acceptance to resolution,
            are in accordance with the release plan, such scenarios may also take
            several months. Second, from the number of Issue updates, we can monitor
            the activity of the Issue processing. The issue update can also include
            reopening the issue, indicating concern about changes in the understanding
            of the issue.
        recent_releases_count: Recent Releases Count
        recent_releases_count_desc: Determine the number of releases in the last year.
        recent_releases_count_more:
          weight: 3.18%
          threshold: '12'
          detail: The high frequency of releases indicates that software artifacts
            are iterating rapidly to respond to user needs. Of course, software projects
            belong to different industries and fields, also decided that the frequency
            of its iterations is not always as high as possible, for example, large
            platform software project release cycle is six months to a year.
    organization_activity:
      title: Organizations Activity
      desc: Organizational activity is used to assess the activity of organizations
        in the community (Business Companies, colleges, etc.) . For an open source
        project, especially for a platform-based software project, the more organizations
        participate in community contributions, indicating that the ecological construction
        of the community is towards prosperity. Because software projects provide
        the business value or academic value-binding that organizations need, organizations
        are willing to participate in community contributions using organizations
        identities.
      metrics:
        org_count: Org Count
        org_count_desc: Number of organizations to which active code contributors
          belong in the past 90 days.
        org_count_more:
          weight: 32.258%
          threshold: '30'
          detail: What we count here are the organizations that contribute code. The
            reason for only counting code contributions is that code contributions
            have the highest technical threshold compared to other types of community
            contributions, and are the most direct manifestation of an organization's
            participation in community contributions. At the same time through the
            analysis of the organization's categories, we can also be more in-depth
            insight, such as understanding of the project's north-south ecological
            construction, etc.
        contributor_count: Organization Contributor Count
        contributor_count_desc: Number of active code contributors with organization
          affiliation in the past 90 days.

          weight: 25.806%
          threshold: '300'
          detail: Here we count the number of code contributors with organized attributes.
            We are here to examine the organization's continued investment in community
            human resources.
        commit_frequency: Commit Frequency
        commit_frequency_desc: 'Definition: Determine the average number of commits
          with organization affiliation per week in the past 90 days.'
        commit_frequency_more:
          weight: 25.81%
          threshold: '800'
          detail: This indicator is similar to the number of contributors and measures
            the organization's input to the community in terms of the number of code
            contributions.
        contribution_last: Contribution Last
        contribution_last_desc: Total contribution time of all organizations to the
          community in the past 90 days (weeks).
        contribution_last_more:
          weight: 16.13%
          threshold: '200'
          detail: We look at the development of ecology in terms of the time dimension,
            through how the organization participates and invests as time goes by.
    contributor_milestone_persona:
      title: Contributor Milestone Persona
      desc: Contributors may resonate with open source projects based on upstream
        or downstream ecological interests, personal development, etc., and engage
        in community contributions. They may stay in the community for a long time,
        gradually fade away, or even be reawakened. Based on these scenarios, we define
        various states of contributors in the community, forming the Milestone Persona
        Model. This model is inspired by a state machine, where contributors can transition
        between states, but they can only be in one state at a time. This ensures
        decoupling of behavior and is more conducive to observing contributors' actions
        in the community.

    contributor_role_persona:
      title: Contributor Role Persona
      desc: Determining whether a contributor is a manager is based on whether they
        have made contributions in issue management or code management categories.
        Of course, a contributor may not be a manager when initially participating
        in community contributions, so we introduce timestamps to mark the change
        in this role. In the two contribution categories mentioned above, if contributors
        declare their organizational identities, such as by forcefully submitting
        code through a public organizational email, we refer to them as organizational
        managers; otherwise, they are considered individual managers.

    contributor_domain_persona:
      title: Contributor Domain Persona
      desc: In the Domain Persona Model, we first categorize the contributions made
        by contributors to the community by domain or type. We strive to atomize the
        contribution domains more finely, matching our current engineering capabilities.
        However, this categorization process is an ongoing evolution, and as our engineering
        capabilities improve, we will be able to achieve more granular domain divisions.For
        observation-type contributions, issue-type contributions, and code-type contributions,
        we can use insights provided by code hosting platforms (such as GitHub, Gitee,
        etc.). For other types of contributions, due to differences in community usage
        and extent, currently we can only provide limited data sources as references.
        However, as our engineering capabilities gradually improve, we may provide
        more solutions.
